# python_learning

Hello!

This repositry is nothing special, just the files I created while learning how to code Python. 
Examples are taken from Eric Matthes book: Python Crash Course, 2nd Edition.
In each chapter there were sections where I had to create my own programs. 

I like keeping these files so I can look back and see my progress. I also like to show them off to employers. 

Thanks for stopping by!
