# python_learning

Hello!

This repositry is nothing special, just the files I created while learning how to code Python.
I like keeping these files so I can look back and see my progress. I also like to show them off to employers. 
Chapter examples are taken from Eric Matthes book: Python Crash Course, 2nd Edition. In each chapter there were sections where I had to create my own programs. Those secctions have been moved to a folder called 'challenges' in each chapter (chapter 1 didn't really have any).

I am looking forward to the next section of this book where I will be doinhg 3 different projects:
Alien Invasion: Making a Game with Python
Data Visualisation
Web Applications

Thanks for stopping by!
