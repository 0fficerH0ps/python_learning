# 6-2. Favorite Numbers: Use a dictionary to store people’s favorite numbers.
# Think of five names, and use them as keys in your dictionary. Think of a favorite
# number for each person, and store each as a value in your dictionary. Print
# each person’s name and their favorite number. For even more fun, poll a few
# friends and get some actual data for your program.

person_1 ={'first_name': 'sam', 'favorite_number': ['10', '6']}
person_2 ={'first_name': 'jack', 'favorite_number': ['5', '61']}
person_3 ={'first_name': 'ruth', 'favorite_number': ['18', '26']}
person_4 ={'first_name': 'angela', 'favorite_number': ['11', '46']}
person_5 ={'first_name': 'matt', 'favorite_number': ['13','37']}

print(f"{person_1['first_name'].title()}'s favorite numbers are {person_1['favorite_number']}.")
print(f"{person_2['first_name'].title()}'s favorite numbers are {person_2['favorite_number']}.")
print(f"{person_3['first_name'].title()}'s favorite numbers are {person_3['favorite_number']}.")
print(f"{person_4['first_name'].title()}'s favorite numbers are {person_4['favorite_number']}.")
print(f"{person_5['first_name'].title()}'s favorite numbers are {person_5['favorite_number']}.")

# so each person can have more than one favorite number. Then print each person’s
# name along with their favorite numbers.

# Done.
