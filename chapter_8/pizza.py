# Passing an Arbitrary Number of Arguments

# Sometimes you won’t know ahead of time how many arguments a function
# needs to accept. Fortunately, Python allows a function to collect an arbitrary
# number of arguments from the calling statement.
# For example, consider a function that builds a pizza. It needs to accept a
# number of toppings, but you can’t know ahead of time how many toppings
# a person will want. The function in the following example has one parameter,
# *toppings, but this parameter collects as many arguments as the calling
# line provides:

def make_pizza(*toppings):
    """Print the list of toppings that have been requested."""
    print(toppings)

make_pizza('pepperoni')
make_pizza('mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')

# The asterisk in the parameter name *toppings tells Python to make an
# empty tuple called toppings and pack whatever values it receives into this
# tuple. The print() call in the function body produces output showing that
# Python can handle a function call with one value and a call with three
# values. It treats the different calls similarly. Note that Python packs the
# arguments into a tuple, even if the function receives only one value:

# ('pepperoni',)
# ('mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')

# Now we can replace the print() call with a loop that runs through the
# list of toppings and describes the pizza being ordered:

def make_pizza(*toppings):
    """Summarize the pizza we are about to make."""
    print("\nMaking a pizza with the following toppings:")
    for topping in toppings:
        print(f"- {topping}")

make_pizza('pepperoni')
make_pizza('mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')

# The function responds appropriately, whether it receives one value or
# three values:

# Making a pizza with the following toppings:
# - pepperoni
# Making a pizza with the following toppings:
# - mushrooms
# - green peppers
# - extra cheese

# This syntax works no matter how many arguments the function receives.


# Mixing Positional and Arbitrary Arguments

# If you want a function to accept several different kinds of arguments, the
# parameter that accepts an arbitrary number of arguments must be placed
# last in the function definition. Python matches positional and keyword
# arguments first and then collects any remaining arguments in the final
# parameter.
# For example, if the function needs to take in a size for the pizza, that
# parameter must come before the parameter *toppings:

def make_pizza(size, *toppings):
    """Summarize the pizza we are about to make."""
    print(f"\nMaking a {size}-inch pizza with the following toppings:")
    for topping in toppings:
        print(f"- {topping}")

make_pizza(16, 'pepperoni')
make_pizza(12, 'mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')

# In the function definition, Python assigns the first value it receives to
# the parameter size. All other values that come after are stored in the tuple
# toppings. The function calls include an argument for the size first, followed
# by as many toppings as needed.
# Now each pizza has a size and a number of toppings, and each piece of
# information is printed in the proper place, showing size first and toppings
# after

# You’ll often see the generic parameter name *args, which collects arbitrary positional
# arguments like this.
