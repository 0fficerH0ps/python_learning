# Using Arbitrary Keyword Arguments

# Sometimes you’ll want to accept an arbitrary number of arguments, but you
# won’t know ahead of time what kind of information will be passed to the
# function. In this case, you can write functions that accept as many key-value
# pairs as the calling statement provides. One example involves building user
# profiles: you know you’ll get information about a user, but you’re not sure
# what kind of information you’ll receive. The function build_profile() in the
# following example always takes in a first and last name, but it accepts an
# arbitrary number of keyword arguments as well:

def build_profile(first, last, **user_info):
    """Build a dictionary containing everything we know about a user."""
    user_info['first_name'] = first
    user_info['last_name'] = last
    return user_info

user_profile = build_profile('albert', 'einstein',
                            location='princeton',
                            field='physics')

print(user_profile)

# The returned dictionary contains the user’s first and last names and,
# in this case, the location and field of study as well. The function would
# work no matter how many additional key-value pairs are provided in the
# function call.

# You can mix positional, keyword, and arbitrary values in many different
# ways when writing your own functions. It’s useful to know that all
# these argument types exist because you’ll see them often when you start
# reading other people’s code. It takes practice to learn to use the different
# types correctly and to know when to use each type. For now, remember to
# use the simplest approach that gets the job done. As you progress you’ll
# learn to use the most efficient approach each time.

# You’ll often see the parameter name **kwargs used to collect non-specific keyword
# arguments
