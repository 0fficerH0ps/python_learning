# Boolean Expressions

# As you learn more about programming, you’ll hear the term Boolean
# expression at some point. A Boolean expression is just another name for a
# conditional test. A Boolean value is either True or False, just like the value
# of a conditional expression after it has been evaluated.
# Boolean values are often used to keep track of certain conditions, such
# as whether a game is running or whether a user can edit certain content on
# a website
game_active = True
can_edit = False
