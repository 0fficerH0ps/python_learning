# 5-8. Hello Admin: Make a list of five or more usernames, including the name
# 'admin'. Imagine you are writing code that will print a greeting to each user
# after they log in to a website. Loop through the list, and print a greeting to
# each user:
# • If the username is 'admin', print a special greeting, such as Hello admin,
#	 would you like to see a status report?
# • Otherwise, print a generic greeting, such as Hello Jaden, thank you for
# 	logging in again.

user_names = ['bob', 'sam', 'jack', 'angela', 'maria', 'marry']

for user_name in user_names:
	if user_name == 'admin':
		print("Hello Admin, would you like to see a status report?")
	elif user_name != []:
		print(f"Welcome back {user_name.title()}.")
	else:
		print('We need to find some users!')
print("Don't forget to drink water today.")
	
# 5-9. No Users: Add an if test to hello_admin.py to make sure the list of users is
# not empty.
# • If the list is empty, print the message We need to find some users!
# • Remove all of the usernames from your list, and make sure the correct
# 	message is printed.


# 5-10. Checking Usernames: Do the following to create a program that simulates
# how websites ensure that everyone has a unique username.
# • Make a list of five or more usernames called current_users.
# • Make another list of five usernames called new_users. Make sure one or
#   two of the new usernames are also in the current_users list.
# • Loop through the new_users list to see if each new username has already
#   been used. If it has, print a message that the person will need to enter a
#   new username. If a username has not been used, print a message saying
#   that the username is available.
# • Make sure your comparison is case insensitive. If 'John' has been used,
#   'JOHN' should not be accepted. (To do this, you’ll need to make a copy of
#   current_users containing the lowercase versions of all existing users.)

requested_usernames = ['jack', 'Marry', 'paula', 'ben', 'ANGELA']



for requested_username in requested_usernames:
	if requested_username.lower() in user_names:
		print("Enter a new username.")
	else:
		print("Welcome aboard explorer!")

# 5-11. Ordinal Numbers: Ordinal numbers indicate their position in a list,
# such as 1st or 2nd. Most ordinal numbers end in th, except 1, 2, and 3.
# • Store the numbers 1 through 9 in a list.
# • Loop through the list.
# • Use an if-elif-else chain inside the loop to print the proper ordinal ending
#   for each number. Your output should read "1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th
#   7th 8th 9th", and each result should be on a separate line.
