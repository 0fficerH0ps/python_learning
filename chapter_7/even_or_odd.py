# The Modulo Operator

# The modulo operator doesn’t tell you how many times one number fits
# into another; it just tells you what the remainder is.
# When one number is divisible by another number, the remainder is 0,
# so the modulo operator always returns 0. You can use this fact to determine
# if a number is even or odd:

number = input("Enter a number, and I'll tell you if it's even or odd: ")
number = int(number)
if number % 2 == 0:
	print(f"\nThe number {number} is even.")
else:
	print(f"\nThe number {number} is odd.")
# Enter a number, and I'll tell you if it's even or odd: 42
# The number 42 is even.
